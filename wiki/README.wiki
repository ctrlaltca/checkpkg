= Introduction =

This page introduces checkpkg, a tool for slackware and derivative distros.

= History =

Once again, an unix system administrator failed, forgetting an additional space, slash or asterisk in his "rm" command. Then you telephone rings, and you need to fix it.
Checkpkg will help you checking which installed packages miss files on the filesystem, and report them to you (--missing-files option).
Additionally, checkpkg is able to check if any executable binary on your system misses a linked library (--missing-libs option).
